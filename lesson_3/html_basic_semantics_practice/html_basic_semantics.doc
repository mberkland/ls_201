1. Which of these tags are semantic, and which are not?
- Semantic: <article>, <h3>, <aside>, <header>, <section>, <footer>, <strong>
- Non-Semantic: <b>, <div>, <span>

2. Given the following HTML, would <section>, <aside>, <article>, or <div> be the most appropriate element for the tag shown as <sometag>?
- <article> would be the most approrpiate tag since this content stands alone and could be copied and used on other sites with no loss of meaning.

3. Given the HTML from question 2, would it be appropriate to replace the <article> tag with <address> or <blockquote>? If so, which one?
- I would keep the <article> tag and then nest a <blockquote> inside of it. Blockquote is appropriate becuase this is a long direct quote.

4. Given the following HTML, would <section>, <aside>, <article>, or <div> be the most appropriate element for the tag shown as <sometag>?
- <section> would be the most appropriate tag. It's a clear section of content but cannot stand alone and therefore shouldn't be an <article>. 

5. Given the following HTML, would <aside>, <section>, <blockquote>, or <div> be the most appropriate element for the tag shown as <sometag>?
- <aside> would be the most appropriate tag. The text is a comment or aside that is related to the content above it.
